# **OT 2022**

My submissions for OT 2022 period 4 course.

I will now leave you with a famous movie monologue:

>Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Plagueis The Wise? 
>I thought not. 
>It’s not a story the Jedi would tell you. 
>It’s a Sith legend. 
>Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the midichlorians to create life… 
>He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying. 
>The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. 
>He became so powerful… the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. 
>Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. 
>Ironic. 
>He could save others from death, but not himself.
>-Chancellor Palpatine
